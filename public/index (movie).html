<hr />
<h3>2001: A Space Odyssey</h3>
<p>This is one of the most original films of all time in all aspects.</p>
<h3>A Clockwork Orange</h3>
<p>It's from the same director, i.e. Stanley Kubrick and is a great philosophical meditation of the relation of society and individual.</p>
<h3>Kill Bill Vol. 1</h3>
<p>This is from one of my favorite directors, Quentin Tarantino, and it's basically the coolest and most stylish movie ever.</p>
